# Jeedom Ajax Bridge

# Early UNTESTED VERSION

Fully Integrate Ajax to Home Assistant via Jeedom 

# Jeedom
Please google how to setup Jeedom with Ajax and MQTT Manager plugin.
This integration needs
1. Jeedom with public Access
2. API Key from Jeedom (sysyem->configuration->APIs->API Key)
3. Configure Jeedom to use HA MQTT server. I did it with Wireguard Client addon on HA side and Wireguard server on JeeDom side.
